# Timetick

### Introduction

This application is a basic clone of timetrap, built using Go. It helps users track time across different categories, referred to as "sheets." Each sheet can contain notes that serve as simple descriptions for the tracked time. In simple terms, it's a command-line tool for tracking time by category.

### Commands
- `display`: Display all entries in a specified period or specific sheet.
- `sheet`: Create or change the tracking sheet.
- `start`: Start tracking time.
- `stop`: Stop tracking time.
- `import`: Import trackings from external sources ([Telegram BOT](https://github.com/steveljko/timetick-telegram-bot)).
